Building a multiplayer online game using Spring Boot is an exciting project!

1. Define Game Requirements
Decide the type of game (e.g., strategy, board, action).
Determine whether itâ€™s turn-based or real-time.
Identify the multiplayer architecture:
Peer-to-peer (P2P): Players directly connect to each other.
Client-server: A centralized server manages all communication.

2. Project Setup
Use Spring Initializr to create a new project.
Dependencies:
Spring Web
Spring Data JPA (for database interactions)
WebSocket (for real-time communication)
Spring Security (for authentication/authorization)
MySQL Driver (as you are using MySQL)
